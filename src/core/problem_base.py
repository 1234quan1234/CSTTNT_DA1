class ProblemBase(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for optimization problems.
    
    All optimization problems (Sphere, Rastrigin, TSP, Knapsack, etc.) must
    inherit from this class and implement the required methods to work with
    the optimization algorithms.
    
    This design allows optimizers to work with any problem type in a uniform way,
    as long as the problem implements the required interface.

    @abstractmethod
    def evaluate(self, x: np.ndarray) -> float:
        """
        Evaluate the objective function at a given solution.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        x : np.ndarray
            The solution to evaluate.
            - For continuous problems: shape (dim,) real-valued vector
            - For TSP: shape (num_cities,) integer permutation
            - For knapsack: shape (num_items,) binary 0/1 vector

        Returns
        -------
        fitness : float
            The objective function value. Lower is better (minimization).
        
        Notes
        -----
        All problems should be formulated as minimization problems.
        For maximization problems, return the negated objective value.

        repr_type : str

        Generate n random valid initial solutions.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        rng : np.random.RandomState
            Random number generator for reproducibility.
        n : int, default=1
            Number of solutions to generate.
        
        Returns
        -------
        solutions : np.ndarray
            Array of n random solutions.
            - For continuous problems: shape (n, dim)
            - For TSP: shape (n, num_cities) with integer permutations

        Notes
        -----
        Solutions should be valid according to problem constraints.
        For example, TSP solutions should be valid permutations,
        knapsack solutions can be repaired to satisfy capacity constraints.

        ----------
        X : np.ndarray
            Solutions to clip/repair. Same shape as returned by init_solution().
        
        Returns
        -------
        X_clipped : np.ndarray

        For discrete problems, validity is often handled by specialized operators.
